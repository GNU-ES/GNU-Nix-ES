## The recommended way to use python is to use poetry2nix



**Note:** many, if not all, tutorials does not use `flake` to be complitely reprodutible. It, in my opinion, 
is not ideal. In my point of view as a comunity we should show, even for beginers, all power of the `Nix` as a 
build system. Put in another way: every exemple must be done using `flake` (I know that it is a experiemntal feature, 
but it reaches or goes around the perfection in terms of reprodutibility if it is used, so, why not?!).
